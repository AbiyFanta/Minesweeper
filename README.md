# Minesweeper

# Description
Minesweep is a game I remember playing on my dads now old Widows Vista laptop. It was a simple yet fun to play game. I can't explain the rules too well so refer to [encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) if you're confused. Basically you click on a tile and you'll get a number in that tile.(assuming you don't hit a mine first try) This number represents the number of bombs within the 8 surroundings tiles. You'll likely have other empty tiles or tiles with numbers on them. It is up to you to decipher these numbers and avoid triggering the bombs. You can right click to flag a spot if you're sure it's a bomb. You can double right click to mark it with a question mark if you're not sure yet. Or you can click it again to reset it back to normal. Hitting a bomb is game over, good luck!

# Features
- Left click to dig up a square
- Right click to flag, double-right to mark as question mark, and a third click to reset to normal

# Installation
You can clone to repository:
git clone: https://github.com/AbiyFanta/Minesweeper
It should be able to run on most if not all web browsers, I tried on chrome and Opera and they worked fine.

# Contributions
Shout out Bill Gates for making Microsoft which in turn collabed with Arkadium to make this banger of a game. ðŸ”¥ I'll be honest my re-creation wasn't perfect but I'd like to see this recreation be improved to include most if not all the features of the original game.
